## Tips

1. Data analysis frameworks: https://www.kaggle.com/rohanrao/tutorial-on-reading-large-datasets/
2. "Finally got a competitive score with a sequential model -> 77.1 public lb. I am just glad the pipeline is working smooth. [@abdurrafae](https://www.kaggle.com/abdurrafae) It takes my pipeline about an hour + for inference on the entire test set as well" in answer to https://www.kaggle.com/c/riiid-test-answer-prediction/discussion/193276
3. Transformers: someone used transformers and ignored students with 1500+ answers https://www.kaggle.com/claverru/demystifying-transformers-let-s-make-it-public
4. Some people did previous data processing like getting a user distribution regarding its performance: % of correct answers, mean content accuracy, number of user answers
5. Lectures cannot be just thrown out in the table and make the algorithm parse it. We should give it a special treatment like improving user heuristics (similar to how previous papers had user metadata like its knowledge).
